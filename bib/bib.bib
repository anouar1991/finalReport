abstract="This paper describes an automated process for designing analog electrical circuits based on the principles of natural selection, sexual recombination, and developmental biology. The design process starts with the random creation of a large population of program trees composed of circuit-constructing functions. Each program tree specifies the steps by which a fully developed circuit is to be progressively developed from a common embryonic circuit appropriate for the type of circuit that the user wishes to design. The fitness measure is a user-written computer program that may incorporate any calculable characteristic or combination of characteristics of the circuit. The population of program trees is genetically bred over a series of many generations using genetic programming. Genetic programming is driven by a fitness measure and employs genetic operations such as Darwinian reproduction, sexual recombination (crossover), and occasional mutation to create offspring. This automated evolutionary process produces both the topology of the circuit and the numerical values for each component. This paper describes how genetic programming can evolve the circuit for a difficult-to-design low-pass filter.",

abstract="In this paper, we proposed a novel method for protein secondary structure prediction using sequence profile and conserved domain profile. Sequence profile generated from PSI-BLAST (position specific iterated BLAST) has been widely used in protein secondary structure prediction, because PSI-BLAST shows good performance in finding remote homology. Conserved domains kept functional and structural information of related proteins; therefore we could draw remote homology information in conserved domains using RPS-BLAST (reverse position specific BLAST). We combined sequence profile and conserved domain profile to get more remote homology information, and propose a method which used the combined profile to predict the protein secondary structures. In order to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we implemented a protein secondary structure prediction system. Overall prediction accuracy reached 75.9{\%} on the RS126 data set. The improvement by incorporating conserved domain information exceeded 3{\%}, and this result showed that our proposed method could improve significantly the accuracy of protein secondary structure prediction.",

Training dataset consisted of forty molecules and the remaining six molecules were chosen for test set validation. SVM under Gaussian Kernel Function yielded non-linear QSAR models. Forward selection algorithm was applied after pruning and redundancy check on molecular descriptors. Internal validations of QSAR models have been achieved using RCV2(LOO), PRESS, SDEP and Y-Scrambling. SVM aided non-linear models are more efficient when optimization of Gaussian Kernel Function was introduced. Non-linear QSAR studies further identified atomic van der Waals volumes, atomic masses, sum of geometrical distances between O..S and degree of unsaturation as molecular descriptors and crucial structural requirements to model IC50 of C-aryl glucoside derivatives.",
