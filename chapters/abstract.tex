Tuberculosis disease remains a global threat and a leading cause of death. The world health organization stressed on increasing the decline rate of the disease. Early diagnosis and evaluation of the TB severity stage are important for determining the right treatment and eventually avoiding the death of curable patients cases. The voluminous amount of medical images available and the proven performance of deep learning in medical diagnosis are a motive for an automatic medical diagnosis to tackle the high demand for radiologists and reduce the costs of diagnosis. Furthermore, there has been considerable growth in recent years in the field of deep learning, which allows performing hard classification tasks. Particularly in computer vision fields, it has been tested and proven that deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are very promising algorithms for various visual tasks. In ImageCLEF2017 severity score task, the results obtained were very good, supporting the applicability of assessing the severity based only on the CT image. Thus, in this paper, we are interested in an automatic TB severity scoring by applying deep learning techniques on annotated chest CT scans. Furthermore, expolore various ways to avert the weak points of the work of the state of the art. Eventually, reaching better results.
